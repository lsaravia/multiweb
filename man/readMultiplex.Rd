\title{Read ecological multiplex networks using different files for each layer as a 'node-aligned' multilayer network}
\usage{
readMultiplex(
  fileName,
  types = c("Negative", "Positive", "Antagonistic"),
  filePath = NULL,
  fhead = TRUE,
  skipColumn = 1,
  format = "layers"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fileName}{vector of fileNames with the layers of the networks}

\item{types}{vector of types that represent the layers}

\item{filePath}{path of the files NULL by default}

\item{fhead}{TRUE if the files have header fields, FALSE otherwise.}

\item{format}{string, "layers" is the default were diferent layers are coded as different files
there must be the same number of files as the length of the types vector as each type represent
a layer. "GLV" Represent multiple intarction types as pairs of entries in a matrix so competition
is represented as a\link{i,j}= -1, a\link{j,i}=-1, predation a\link{i,j}=1,a\link{j,i}=-1 where species j is
the predator. Mutualism is a\link{i,j}=a\link{j,i}=1. Any negative or positive number works because intensity of interactions are not registered.}

\item{skipColum}{integer, number of columns that are skiped 1 by default}
}
\value{
an mgraph object that is a list of igraph objects with the type attribute set to each kind of layer or interaction
}
\description{
This functions uses \code{\link[=readNetwork]{readNetwork()}} to read files that represent network layers that can be
different interaction types, represented by the type attribute of the igraph object.
