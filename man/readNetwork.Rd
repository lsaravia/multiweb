\title{Read ecological networks in CSV or tab separated file format as edge list or adyacency matrix}
\usage{
readNetwork(
  fileName,
  filePath = NULL,
  fhead = TRUE,
  skipColumn = 1,
  edgeListFormat = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fileName}{vector of fileNames with the networks}

\item{filePath}{path of the files NULL by default}

\item{fhead}{TRUE if the files have header fields, FALSE otherwise.}

\item{edgeListFormat}{integer, for the edge list format, if 1 the first column is the "in" (the predator),
if 2 the first column is the "out" link (the prey).}

\item{skipColum}{integer, number of columns that are skiped 1 by default}
}
\value{
an igraph object if there is only one file or a list of igraph objects named after the list without extension
}
\description{
If the network is in edge list format and there is a third column is treated as an edge attribute with the name of the column
}
\examples{

# Reads a network in edge list (interaction list) format, with predators as the first column by default
#
fileName <- system.file("extdata", "WeddellSea_FW.csv", package = "multiweb")
g <- readNetwork(fileName)

# Reads a network in adyacency matrix format, with predators as columns
#
fileName <- system.file("extdata", "BarentsBoreal_FW.csv", package = "multiweb")
g <- readNetwork(fileName)

# Read a vector of files
#
\dontrun{
dn <- list.files("inst/extdata",pattern = "^.*\\\\.csv$")
netData <- readNetwork(dn,"inst/extdata")
}
