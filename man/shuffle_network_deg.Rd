\title{Degree-Preserving Network Shuffling via Edge Swaps}
\usage{
shuffle_network_deg(input_graph, delta = 100, directed = TRUE, weighted = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{delta}{Number of edge swaps to perform.}

\item{A}{A square adjacency matrix (directed, weighted or unweighted).}

\item{max_attempts}{Number of times to attempt a valid swap before stopping.}
}
\value{
A shuffled adjacency matrix preserving in-degree and out-degree.
}
\description{
This function shuffles a directed network while preserving node degrees.
It follows a controlled randomization process by swapping edges iteratively.
