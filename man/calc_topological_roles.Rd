\title{Calc topological roles among network communities/modules}
\usage{
calc_topological_roles(g, nsim = 1000, ncores = 0, community = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{an Igraph object with the network}

\item{nsim}{number of simulations for \code{\link[igraph:cluster_spinglass]{igraph::cluster_spinglass()}} method}

\item{ncores}{number of cores to use paralell computation, if 0 sequential processing is used.}

\item{community}{a community object obtained with other method, if NULL the community is calculated with \code{\link[igraph:cluster_spinglass]{igraph::cluster_spinglass()}}}
}
\value{
a  data frame with two numeric fields: within_module_degree, among_module_conn
}
\description{
Topological roles characterize species as its roles between communities or modules, we calculate the modules using
\code{\link[igraph:cluster_spinglass]{igraph::cluster_spinglass()}} function. Alternatively you can pass a community object obtained with other method using the
parameter \code{community}.
Topological roles are described by two parameters: the standardized within-module degree \eqn{dz} and the among-module
connectivity participation coefficient \eqn{PC}.  The within-module degree is a z-score that measures how well a species is
connected to other species within its own module compared with a random graph. The participation coefficient \eqn{PC}
estimates the distribution of the links of species among modules. As the community algorithm is stochastic we run it several
times and return the repeated runs for both parameters.
